**JPEG-XL Translator** for [Haiku](https://www.haiku-os.org/).

This is a Translator for converting to and from JPEG-XL files within Haiku OS.

It depends upon [libjxl](https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl) and is mostly based on example code from that project and other existing Translators for Haiku.

It does not support animation or ICC profiles currently.  I'm not sure if they are possible/convenient at this time.

**NOTE**: This project has been abandoned and is now maintained at https://codeberg.org/Hanicef/JXLTranslator instead.
